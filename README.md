# Starter React App

## Quickstart
- in terminal, navigate to this folder and type `npm install` - this will install all the required dependencies from package.json (as well as their dependencies, and so on)
- then, you can just start the app with `npm run watch`

## Tech Patterns
- React
  - Create React App (build process)
  - Patterns from 11/6/2016 videos of reactforbeginners.com by Wes Bos
  - Using React Router 4 (with Match and Miss)
- CSS
  - using Skeleton CSS for a grid layout (and normalization)
  - Stylus for CSS Pre-processing -- type `npm run watch` during development to keep style.css in sync
- Data
  - Includes sample-data.js for intial data
- Meteor
- Deployment
  - via zeit.co/now and now-serve for quick static site deployment (after `npm run build` just type `npm run deploy`)

## Goals
1. Be a boilerplate for UI designers and front end developers
2. Add in Meteor for a simple Node.js API and authentication
3. Deploy a free app using Heroku and MongoLab sandbox db - https://www.coshx.com/blog/2016/08/19/how-to-deploy-a-meteor-1-4-app-to-heroku/
4. Deploy production app using galaxy.meteor.com and compose.io

## Feature Ideas
- authentication
- mobile navbar
- Integrate with REST APIs
